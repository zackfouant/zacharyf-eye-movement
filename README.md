This project takes mouse movement and transforms the positioning of the two "pupils" inside the eye divs to follow and mimic it's movements, relative to where it is on the screen.

# Future Implementations Roadmap

- v2.0 implement code to toggle if pupils mimic mouse movement or triangulate it's position (ex. putting it in the center should cause the eyes to go cross-eyed)
- v3.0 allow customization of eye (sclera and iris colors, pupil style, etc.)
